<p>Post-doctoral academic researcher and independent consultant with extensive experience in local governance and public policy.</p>

<h2 id="research-interests">Research interests</h2>

<p>My PhD, from the University of Nottingham, examined responses to austerity in English local governance between 2010 and 2015.</p>

<p>The research found that although surface-level stability had been maintained in local services, local political ‘traditions’ were under coming pressure as a result of spending cuts.  The thesis went on to argue that the significance of institutional change can only be appreciated with reference to local meaning and context, and that seemingly minor incremental changes have longer-term potential to transform local governance.</p>

<p>Ongoing research interests include the relationship between civil society, faith communities and the local state, and the implications of the Conservatives ‘devolution revolution’ for local governance.  I am also interested in collaborative and asset-based research methodologies, and in exploring connections between institutional and interpretive models of change.</p>

<p>The Conservatives show a new assertiveness in relation to restructuring the local state, promoting devolution as a strategy to stimulate economic growth, based on greater sub-regional autonomy and increased competitiveness across and between English localities.</p>

<p>‘Combined authorities’ have the opportunity to champion local identities and acquire new economic development powers from Whitehall, but devolution may also be a strategy to decentralise austerity, shifting responsibility to the local level for deeper cuts and inevitable service reductions. Local government confronts ‘super-austerity’, where new cuts come on top of previous ones, compounding original impacts and creating dangerous (and unevenly spread) multiplier effects.</p>

<p>The emerging patchwork of ‘devolution deals’ challenges the redistributive assumptions of the grant regime and could leave disadvantaged areas at particular risk of failure. ‘Metro mayors’ are intended to provide visible and accountable leadership; but roles for locally elected councillors, and prospects for community and citizen engagement, remain unclear. The public has yet to be adequately engaged in what is in danger of becoming a technocratic transfer of power.</p>

(2016). ‘Negotiating Austerity and Local Traditions’ in M. Bevir and M. Rhodes (eds) <em>Rethinking Governance: Ruling, Rationalities and Resistance</em>, (pp.125-143). London: Routledge</h3>
<p>English local government has faced a ‘perfect storm’ of radical spending cuts alongside rising demands for services, and yet has retained a surprising degree of resilience.  This chapter addresses the ‘austerity puzzle’; how can we explain the apparent disconnect between the pressures on local government and its apparent capacity to act?  Inspired by Bevir and Rhodes (2003, 2006) we argue that austerity policies are forcing a reconsideration of the ‘traditions’ that underpin contemporary local governance, with actors actively negotiating paths through austerity by drawing on local government traditions and locality-specific knowledge.  New and productive narratives are emerging, but other negotiations remain incomplete or contested.</p>

<p>Anyone following the news over the last nine months might be forgiven for thinking that the UK’s relationship with austerity had taken a rollercoaster ride.  In June 2015, George Osborne told central government departments to plan for 25-40% spending cuts, citing his aim for the UK to become ‘a country that lives within its means’.  His ‘fiscal charter’ signalled a departure from a historic reliance on government borrowing financed through economic growth, towards an aspiration to consistently deliver a budget surplus from 2019-20 onwards.</p>

<p>The ‘Cities and Local Government Devolution Bill’ published at the end of May 2015 provided the cornerstone for the new government’s flagship decentralisation agenda.  Yet as Professor Robin Hambleton has recently argued, rather than granting increased power to local government, the bill’s focus on a new layer of sub-regional, combined authorities will actually move power further away from local communities.  This problem has potential to be exacerbated by the erosion of local authorities’ ‘community leadership’ role, due to financial pressures associated with austerity.</p>

<p>The Smith Commission’s recommendations towards ‘devo-max’ for Scotland have dragged the question of English devolution out of Whitehall’s cupboard of forgotten political options and thrust it blinking into the political spotlight.  English local authorities have seized this opportunity to lobby Parliament to move beyond the Westminster-centric debate of ‘English votes for English laws’ and decentralise key powers and funding streams to local authorities.</p>

<p>“Public service cuts – did we notice?” asked BBC News back in October, publishing the results of a recent ICM Poll. The item parallels a commonly circulated argument that the unprecedented 28% cuts to local government’s central grant have been delivered without significantly impacting local services.  Can this really be true?</p>

<h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2>

<p>My teaching interests span public administration, politics and international relations.  I have taught seminar groups at undergraduate level on ‘Understanding Global Politics’, ‘Governing Cities’ and ‘British Political History since 1945’.</p>

<p>I am also an experienced facilitator with skills in designing and leading collaborative and participative workshops for local authorities and their partner organisations.</p>

<h2 id="career-history">Career History</h2>

<p>Prior to starting my PhD I worked in policy, performance, and consultancy-based roles for local authorities, the Civil Service, the Improvement and Development Agency for Local Government (IDeA) and the Local Government Association.</p>
